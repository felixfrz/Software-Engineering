# How to Ask Great Questions

Knowing how to ask a good question is a VERY important skill. At App Academy, you will have many opportunities to practice by asking great questions to your classmates, TAs and instructors.

By the end of this reading, you will be able to follow a process for developing and asking great coding questions.

## When should I ask a question?

Follow the 15 minute rule: If you are stuck for more than 15 minutes on a problem with no progress, you are REQUIRED to ask a question.

Think about it: You're a highly paid software engineer paid $50/hr. If you're stuck for two hours with no progress, you've just wasted $100. If you're making no progress after 15 minutes, take some time to put together a good question (more on that below) and ask for help!


## What makes a good question?

1. It's specific
2. It's clear and concise
3. It shows that you've put work into it


## Good questions are specific

Imagine you are the lead on an engineering team and you see a question like this:

”Help! My code isn't working. What do I do?”

How do you answer this? You have no idea if it requires a quick, 30 second fix or a 2 hour deep-dive. Because you're busy and don't know how big of a time commitment this requires, it's likely to go ignored.

Compare to a question like this:

”I'm trying to get the last character in a string using str[str.length] but get undefined. What am I doing wrong?”

This is an easy fix and is likely to get an answer very quickly.

How about something like this:

”I've installed Python 3.8 on my Mac using Homebrew but python3 keeps opening up version 3.6. Can anyone help me?”

Python environments are notorious for growing complicated over time and this issue might take some time to sort out. Because the question is specific, it can still be answered quickly. The specificity allows you to set aside an appropriate amount of time to help solve the problem at hand.

## Good questions are clear and concise
